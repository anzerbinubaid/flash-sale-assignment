# Flash Sale System Design Workshop -  Worksheet that team has to fill or they can make they own format as well


## Overview
Design a high-traffic flash sale system for an e-commerce platform based on the .NET eShop reference architecture. This workshop will test your understanding of scalability, consistency, performance, and system design principles.

### Team Formation Instructions
**Team Requirements:**
- **Team Size:** Minimum 3 members, Maximum 4 members
- **Self-Organization:** Form your own teams based on complementary skills
- **Recommended Team Composition:**
  - 1 System Architect (overall design and integration)
  - 1 Backend Developer (microservices and data design)
  - 1 DevOps/Infrastructure Specialist (deployment and monitoring)
  - 1 Performance/Security Engineer (optional 4th member)

**Team Registration:**
- Choose a team name
- Assign roles and responsibilities
- Designate one team lead for submission coordination

**Scenario:** Your e-commerce platform wants to launch flash sales where limited quantities of products are sold at discounted prices for a short duration (e.g., 1000 units of iPhone at 50% off for 2 hours). The system must handle:
- 100,000+ concurrent users
- High read traffic during sale announcements
- Burst write traffic when sale starts
- Inventory consistency (no overselling)
- Fair ordering (first-come, first-served)

## Reference Architecture
Study the [.NET eShop](https://github.com/dotnet/eShop) microservices architecture and adapt it for flash sale requirements.

## Exercise 2: Data Design

### Task 2.1: Database Schema Design
**Deliverable:** Design database schemas for flash sale entities.

**Flash Sale Service Schema:**
```sql
-- Design your flash sale tables here
-- Consider: flash_sales, flash_sale_items, flash_sale_participants, etc.
CREATE TABLE flash_sales (
  sale_id UUID PRIMARY KEY,
  product_id UUID NOT NULL,
  start_time TIMESTAMP NOT NULL,
  end_time TIMESTAMP NOT NULL,
  discount DECIMAL(5,2),
  total_quantity INT,
  status VARCHAR(20)
);

CREATE TABLE flash_sale_inventory (
  sale_id UUID,
  product_id UUID,
  remaining_quantity INT,
  PRIMARY KEY (sale_id, product_id)
);

CREATE TABLE flash_sale_participants (
  sale_id UUID,
  user_id UUID,
  purchase_time TIMESTAMP,
  quantity INT,
  PRIMARY KEY (sale_id, user_id)
);
```


**Inventory Service Schema:**
```sql

CREATE TABLE inventory (
  product_id UUID PRIMARY KEY,
  total_stock INT,
  reserved_stock INT,
  available_stock INT
);

CREATE TABLE inventory_locks (
  product_id UUID,
  user_id UUID,
  lock_time TIMESTAMP,
  expires_at TIMESTAMP,
  PRIMARY KEY (product_id, user_id)
);

```

### Task 2.2: Caching Strategy
**Deliverable:** Define your caching strategy and data structures.

**Redis Cache Design:**
```
Cache Layer 1 - Application Cache (Redis):
Key Pattern: flash_sale:{sale_id}
Value: { "sale_info": "...", "remaining_stock": "...", "status": "..." }
TTL: 120 seconds

Key Pattern: flash_sale_inventory:{sale_id}:{product_id}
Value:{ "remaining": 120 }
TTL: 60 seconds

Key Pattern: user_session:{user_id}
Value: { "session_token": "...", "expires": "..." }
TTL: 1800 seconds
```

**CDN Cache Strategy:**
```
Static Content Caching:
- Product images: Cache duration 24 hours
- Sale banners: Cache duration 1 hour
- JavaScript/CSS: Cache duration 7 days

Dynamic Content:
- Product availability: Cache duration 30 seconds
- Sale countdown: Use client-side polling or SSE/WebSocket
```

---

## Exercise 3: API Design

### Task 3.1: RESTful API Specification
**Deliverable:** Design the main APIs for flash sale operations.

**Flash Sale Management APIs:**

GET /api/flash-sales/active
Purpose: Fetch currently active flash sales 
Response: List of { saleId, productId, discount, endsIn } 
Caching: Redis + CDN (TTL 30s)

POST /api/flash-sales/{saleId}/purchase
Purpose: Attempt to purchase during flash sale 
Request Body: { "userId": "...", "quantity": 1 } 
Response: { "status": "success", "orderId": "..." } 
Rate Limiting: 1 request/sec per user via Redis token bucket

GET /api/flash-sales/{saleId}/status
Purpose: Get real-time sale status 
Response: { "remainingInventory": 120, "endsIn": "00:15:00" }
Real-time Updates: WebSocket or SSE
```

**Additional APIs:**
```
API: /api/orders/{userId}

Purpose: Fetch user’s flash sale orders 
Request/Response: { orders: [...] }
```

### Task 3.2: Event-Driven Architecture
**Deliverable:** Define events and event handlers for flash sale operations.

Subscribers: InventoryService, NotificationService

Event: InventoryReserved 
Payload: { "saleId": "...", "userId": "...", "quantity": 1 } 
Publishers: OrderService 
Subscribers: InventoryService, PaymentService

- Load balancing algorithm: Round-robin
- Health check: Ping + latency threshold
- Circuit breaker: Open after 5 failures, reset after 30s

Database Load Distribution:
- Read replicas: Serve GET requests from replicas
- Write scaling: Use async queues (e.g., RabbitMQ)
- Sharding: By saleId or productId
```

### Task 4.2: Performance Optimization
**Deliverable:** Identify performance bottlenecks and optimization strategies.

**Bottleneck Analysis:**
| Component | Potential Bottleneck | Optimization Strategy | Expected Improvement |
|-----------|---------------------|----------------------|---------------------|
| Database Writes | High write contention| Async queue + batch inserts| 5x throughput|
| Inventory Checks | Race conditions| Redis atomic Lua scripts| Prevent overselling|
| User Authentication |Token validation latency |JWT with local verification | Reduce auth latency|
| Payment Processing |External API delays | Async confirmation + retries|Improve UX|

**Caching Optimization:**
```
Cache Hit Ratio Targets:
- Product catalog: 95%
- Flash sale status: 90%
- User sessions: 98%

Cache Warming Strategy:
Preload active sales and inventory into Redis before sale starts

Cache Invalidation Strategy:
TTL + event-driven invalidation on sale end or inventory change
```

---

## Exercise 5: Consistency & Reliability

### Task 5.1: Data Consistency Strategy
**Deliverable:** Design your approach to handle data consistency in distributed system.

**ACID vs BASE Trade-offs:**
```
Strong Consistency Requirements:
- Inventory management: Why? Prevent overselling via atomic operations
- Payment processing: Why? Ensure payment confirmation before order finalization
Eventual Consistency Acceptable:
- User notifications: Why? Can be delayed or retried
- Analytics/reporting: Why? Updated asynchronously
```

**Distributed Transaction Handling:**
```
Saga Pattern Implementation:
Step 1: Reserve Inventory
- Success: Lock inventory
- Failure/Compensation: Release lock

Step 2: Process Payment
- Success: Confirm payment
- Failure/Compensation: Cancel reservation

Step 3: Confirm Order
- Success: Mark order complete
- Failure/Compensation: Refund + notify user
```

### Task 5.2: Failure Handling
**Deliverable:** Design fault tolerance and recovery mechanisms.

**Circuit Breaker Configuration:**
```
Service: Payment Service
Failure Threshold: 5
Timeout: 30s
Fallback: Queue for retry + notify user

Service: Inventory Service
Failure Threshold: 3
Timeout: 15s
Fallback: Serve cached inventory + retry
```

**Retry Policies:**
```
Operation: Database Write
Retry Count: 3
Backoff Strategy: Exponential (100ms → 400ms → 800ms)
Circuit Breaker Integration: Pause retries if breaker is open
```

API Security:
- Authentication scheme: Bearer token (JWT)
- Rate limiting strategy: Redis token bucket per IP/user
- DDoS protection: Cloudflare + API Gateway throttling

```

**Data Protection:**
```
PII Data Handling:
- Encryption at rest: AES-256 via database provider
- Encryption in transit: TLS 1.2+
- Data retention policy: 90 days for logs, 1 year for orders

Payment Data:
- PCI DSS compliance approach: Use third-party PCI-compliant gateway (e.g., Stripe)

```

  "timestamp": "...",
  "level": "...",
  "service": "...",
  "traceId": "...",
  "userId": "...",
  "operation": "...",
